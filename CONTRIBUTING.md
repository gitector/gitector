# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Gitector. Here you can find a set of guidelines. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## How to start

You just noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one][new issue]! It's
generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature
request this way before starting to code.

If you have a general question about gitector, you can post it on [Gitter], the issue tracker is only for bugs and feature requests.

## Your First Contribution
1. Create your fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
2. If you like the change and think the project could use it. Send a pull request. Remember to keep name of your branch `feature\bug/(issue ID)-short-description` eg. `feature/432-validate-max-file-size`

## How to report a bug 

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Go are you using (go version)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

## Code review

The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no committer has an objection. During the review, committers may also request that a specific contributor who is most versed in a particular area gives an "LGTM" before the PR merge. There is no additional "sign off" process for contributions to land. Once all issues brought by committers are addressed it can be landed by any committer.
